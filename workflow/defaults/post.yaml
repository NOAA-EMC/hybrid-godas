## Output files
## 
## Specifies which files are saved by the final cycle.post job step, and if any 
##  compression or remapping is performed. Some of these options will not be 
##  actually enabled if the data assimilation method doesn't produce that data.
##  E.g. DA_MODE="var" will cause SAVE_BKG_SPRD to have no effect.
## All output is placed in EXP_DIR/output
##
## SAVE_FORMAT_GRID   : {native, 1, 05, 025} anything other than "native" will 
##                      remap the output to the indicated regular lat/lon grid
##                      resolution.
##                      NOTE: only "native" is supported right now until the scripts
##                      can be finalized.
## SAVE_COMP_LEVEL    : The level of compression to use (0-9). 4 seems to be a good
##                      level. 9 is too slow.
## SAVE_{BKG,ANA}_ENS : Save the individual ensemble background and analysis
##                      members.
##                      NOTE: not yet implemented.
## SAVE_BKG_SLOT      : Save the individual per ensemble member output for all 
##                      timeslots
##                      NOTE: not yet implemented.
## SAVE_{BKG,ANA}_MEAN: Save the background or analysis ensemble mean
## SAVE_{BKG,ANA}_SPRD: Save the background or analysis ensemble spread
## SAVE_ANA_MEAN_LETKF: If running with DA_MODE="hyb", this saves the intermediate
##                      ensemble analysis mean generated by the LETKF step. The
##                      subsequent 3dvar step then adjusts this analysis mean,
##                      saving the final mean via SAVE_ANA_MEAN
## SAVE_OMF           : save the observation minus forecast (O-F) statistics
## SAVE_RST_MINCYCLES : if > 0, the full ensemble restart files for this many of 
##                      the previous cycles are saved so that the experiment can
##                      be rewound several cycles when something goes wrong. 
##                      Restart files from any older cycles are deleted, except
##                      for the first cycle of each year if SAVE_RST_ANUAL=1, or if
##                      the dates match a pattern given by SAVE_RST_REGEX
## SAVE_RST_REGEX     : save the restart files if the date (YYYYMMDDHH) matches the 
##                      provided egrep formated regular expression
## SAVE_RST_ANNUAL    : If =1, the restart files (for the whole ensemble) are saved
##                      at the beginning of each year
